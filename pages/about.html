    <h1>About</h1>
    <p>My name is Himanshu Gupta, a cybersecurity enthusiast and tech geek, and this is a space I created to share my knowledge and experience with the world. (Built on 
    <a href="https://pages.github.com" style="color: white;">Github Pages</a>)</p>
    <p>For a long time, I've just sat on a computer trying to understand how it all works and how I can make it do what I want. Along the way, I learned a lot from simply experimenting and a lot from the community as well, and now I want to give back.</p>
    <p>These days, I am a penetration tester for a startup company, pentesting different types of applications and architectures while also understanding how the business side of this field works.</p>
    <p>Things I care about: open source, good security, and helping others. I hope the material I share is helpful to you folks out there. If you want to discuss or have a doubt about anything related to the field, then connect with me using the information on the contact page. Peace!
